# Breach Bot Code

This is my bot Breach Bot. Made by Nohemi Morales.

### Project Includes the following:
- Varied responses based on user input.
- Use of conditional to identify the details of a data breach and the organization's response.
- Use of while loop to repeat breach research.
- Use of conditional to display three reflections:  your reaction, its connection to the CIA Triad, and your advice.
- Use of while loop to repeat reflections.
- Use of break statement to end the while-loops.

## File Overview

### ← README.md

This program should have a short conversation with an user, no issues encountered so far.
In the future I'd love to add more reponses. This is a project I can possibly integrate into a more complex one in the future.
